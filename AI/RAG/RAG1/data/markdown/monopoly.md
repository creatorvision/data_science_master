Now there's a faster way to play MONOPOLY. Choose to play by
the classic rules for buying, renting and selling properties or use the
Speed Die to get into the action faster. If you've never played the classic
MONOPOLY game, refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page.
If you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just
read the section below for the additional Speed Die rules.

SPEED DIE RULES
Learnins how to Play with the S~eed Die IS as
/ fast as playing with i't.
When starting the game, hand out an extra $1,000 to each player
(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you'll need
the extra cash to buy and build.
Do not use the Speed Die until you've landed on or passed over
GO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you'll
use the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some
players will start using the die before others.
Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two
white dice on your turn. Then do the following depending on
what you rolled.
1, 2, or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white
dice. You'll zoom around the board.
Bus: This lets you "get off the bus early." Look at the two white
dice. You can move the value of one die, the other die, or the
sum of both dice. So if you rolled a 1 and a 5, you can move
1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \t's your choice.
Mr. Monopoly: First, move the sum of the two white dice
and resolve the space you land on (such as drawing a card,
buying the property, paying rent, etc.). Then, one of two
things will happen depending on whether or not there is still
property in the bank.
YES, there is property in the bank -Advance to the NEXT
property that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you
don't want to buy this property, move to the space anyway
and put the property up for auction.
NO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the
NOCT property on which you will owe another player money.
A few minor details:

Only the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles.
Do not look at the Speed Die.
If you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number),
you can move anywhere you want on the board!
If you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the "Go
to Jail" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn
is over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn.
Use the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail.
L
Use the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on
a utility. Note: The Bus and Mr. Monopoly are valued at 0.
CLASSIC MONOPOW RULES
OBJECT: The object of the game IS to become the
wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling
property.
PREPARATION: Place the board on a table and put
the Chance and Community Chest cards facedown on
their allotted spaces on the board. Each player chooses one token to
represent himther while traveling around the board.
Each player is given $1,500 divided as follows: P each of $500s,
$100~ and $50~; 6 $40~; 5 each of $105, $5~ and $Is.
All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. Stack the ..
Bank's money on edge in the compartments in the plastic Banker's tray.

BANKER. Select as Banker a player who will also
make a good Auctioneer A Banker who plays
~n the game must keep hislher personal funds
separate from those of the Bank. When more than
f~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only
as Banker and Auctioneer.

THE BANK: Besides the Bank's money, the Bank
holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase
and use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells
and auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards;
it sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when
required on mortgages.
The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of
all properties which it sells and auctions.
The Bank nwer "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker
may issue as much more as needed by writing on any ordinary paper.
THE PLAY: Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice.
The player with the highest total starts the play: Place your
token on the corner marked "GO," throw the dice and move
your token in the direction of the arrow the number of
spaces indicated by the dice. After you have completed
your play, the turn passes to the left. The tokens remain
on the spaces qccupied and proceed from that point on
the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the
same space at the same time.
According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to
buy real estate or other properties - or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes,
draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail," etc.
If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the
two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
the space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move
your token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession,
move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).

"GO": Each time a player's token lands on or passes over
GO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card,
the Banker pays himther a $200 sala,ry.

The $200 is paid only once each time kound
the board. However, if a player passing GO on
the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it
on Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond
it on Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, helshe collects
$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the
second time by instructions on the card.

BUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you
may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the
Title Deed card showing ownership; place it faceup in front of you.

If you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction
to the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid
in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player,
including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed
price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.
PAMNG When you land on property owned by another player,
the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on
its Title Deed card.
If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a
property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed facedown in front
of the owner. L
It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-
group (e.g., Boardwalk and Park Place; or Connecticut, Vermont and
Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent
for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to
unmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is
mortgaged.
It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties
because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.
The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask for it before
the second player following throws the dice.
"CHANCE" AND "COMMUNITY CHEST": When you land on either of
these spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, follow the

instructions and return the card facedown to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to
the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use
it, helshe may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable
to both.

"INCOME TAX": If you land here you have two options: You may
estimate your tax at $900 and pay the Bank, or you may pay 10% of
your total worth to the Bank. Your total worth is all your cash on hand,
printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged properties and cost
price of all buildings you own.

You must decide which option you will take before you add up
your total worth.

"JAIL": You land in Jail when. ..(I) your token lands on the space
marked "Go to Jail"; (2) you draw a card marked "Go to JailN; or
(3) you throw doubles three times in succession.

When you are sent to Jail you cannot
collect your $200 salary in that move
since, regardless of where your token
is on the board, you must move it
directly into Jail. Your turn ends when
you are sent to Jail.

If you are not "sent" to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on
that space, you are "Just Visiting," you incur no penalty, and you move
ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

You get out of Jail by.. .(I) throwing doubles on any of your next
three turns; if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward
the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even though you
had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn; (2) using the "Get
Out of Jail Free" card if you have it; (3) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail
Free" card from another player and playing it; (4) paying a fine of $
before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.
If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $
fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number
of spaces shown by your throw.
Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell property, buy and
sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

"FREE PARKING": A player landing on this place does not
receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a "free"
resting place.

HOUSES: When you own all the propert~es in a color-group
you may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties.

If you buy one house, you may put it on any
one of those properties. The next house you
buy must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-
group you may own.

The price you must pay the Bank for each
house is shown on your ltle Deed card for the
property on which you erect the house.
The owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on
the unimproved properties of hisher complete color-group.

Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as
many houses as your judgement and financial standing will allow. But
you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on
any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on
wery property of that group. You may then begin on the second row
of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For
example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have
only one house on another property of that group.
As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly ifyou sell
houses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).
HOTELS: When a player has four houses on each property of a
complete color-group, hdshe may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect
it on any property of the color-group. Hdshe returns the four houses
from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown
on the Ttle Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one
property.
BUILDING SHORTAGES: When the Bank has no houses to sell, players
wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell histher
houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of
houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more
than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the
highest bidder.

SELLING PROPERN: Unimproved properties, railroads and util~ties
(but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction

for any amount the owner can get; however, no property can be sold to -
another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-
group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before
the owner can sell any property of that color-group.

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-
half the price paid for them.
All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be
sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
MORTGAGES: Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the
Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged, all
the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back
to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title
Deed card.
No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities,
but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the
same group.
In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of
a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
back houses at full price.
The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and
no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player
at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage
at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus
10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted
at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when
you buy the property and if you lift the
mortgage later you must pay the Bank
an additional 10% interest as well
as the amount of the mortgage.
n
BANKRUPTCY.. You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you
can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your ,
debt is to another player, you must tum over to that
player all that you have of value and retire from the
game. In making this settlement, if you own houses or
hotels, you must retum these to the Bank in exchange
for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid
for them; this cash is given to the creditor. If you have
mortgaged property you also turn this property over
to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay.
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of
the property. The new owner who does this may then, at hislher option,
pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then lift the
mortgage. If helshe holds property in this way until a later turn, helshe
must pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage.
Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you
can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings
and mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In
this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken,
except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the
game. The last player left in the game wins.

MISCEUANEOUS: Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank
and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or
lend money to another player. L
