These entities include hedge funds, pensions funds,\\nmutual funds, money managers or insurance companies, for example.\\nRetail Investors: Also known as an individual investor, is a non-professional investor\\nwho buys and sells securities or funds that contain a basket of securities such as\\nmutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). Retail investors execute their\\ntrades through traditional or online brokerage firms or other type of investment\\naccounts. \\nPrivate Company: Companies that are held privately means that, in most cases, the\\ncompany is owned by its founders, management, or a group of private investors. A\\nprivate company can’t rely on selling stocks or bonds on the public market in order\\nto raise cash to fund its growth. \\n3\\n www.getirwin.com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Unlike ESG Scores which are determined for\\nevery publicly traded company, reporting against a framework is completely\\nvoluntary. Not only is using a reporting framework useful for shareholders and\\npotential investors to understand your company’s ESG efforts, it also signifies that\\nyour company is taking an active approach to ESG. \\nThere are several frameworks you can choose from to tell your ESG story.\\nAccording to ESG Infinite, the framework set by the Sustainability Accounting\\nStandards Board (SASB) is generally the preferred framework for issuers who are\\njust starting out with ESG.

A good place to start is to compare your company to peers. You should\\ninvestigate your peers’ ESG scores and their disclosures to help understand what\\nother key players in the industry are doing to move the dial on ESG. You can bring\\nthese findings to management to demonstrate viable opportunities to improve\\nupon your company’s ESG strategy. \\nPublish your ESG disclosures\\nOnce you’ve finished your first ESG disclosure, you should make it accessible to\\ninvestors. Publishing your ESG disclosures on your website is a good starting point,\\nand you may also wish to update your current shareholders to let them know. Once\\nyour disclosure is published, you can also leverage it in your investor outreach to aid\\nyour discussions with socially conscious investors. Remember, ESG is an ongoing\\ncommitment and companies are expected to share updates on an annual or more\\nfrequent basis.

The formula for WACC is as\\nfollows:\\nThere are several methods to calculate the cost of equity, however the Capital\\nAsset Pricing Model (CAPM) is the one most commonly used.
